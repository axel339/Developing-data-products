Developing-data-products: BMI calculator
========================

Don't forget to load in the shiny R package with the command `library(shiny)`.
You can chose between two different unit systems if you prefer your weight in kg or pound and your height in Meters or Feet/Inches. The inches input will display only if you select your height to be in feet and then click on the submit button.
